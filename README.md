## About/Purpose ❔
---
The purpose of this webpage is to utilize javascript and create a password generator which accepts a specific set of criteria from the user and outputs a random password containing at least one of each type selected.


## Takeaways 🥡
--- 
* Learned the value of psuedo code to plan out the logic
* Gained confidence in use of objects and the efficiency of dot notation
* Learned how to escape special VSCode characters to see them as their actual character instead of a inherit function
* *WAS REALLY HARD* Figured out how to traverse an OBJECT that has an ARRAY of OBJECTS via Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
* Learned the effectiveness of using true and false; which can be added together to sum to a number
* Learned how to refactor my own code by researching other tactics for handling certain situations, then implementing/retrofitting the code accordingly
* Learned that chartypes have a computer ALT code associated with them
